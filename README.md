# How To Use
When opening, a popup window will appear. Input the parameters into the window.

The right side of the window is a task bar. At the top of the bar is the productivity reminder. If it is blue, the team is on track.
If it is yellow, the team is a little bit behind. If the bar is red, the team is behind.
Right below, there is a button to change the parameters on a similar screen to the beginning popup.
If a blank is not filled, the parameter will not change.
Below that is a speaker. If people need to hear the progress of the current task outside of the refresh, 
a message will be played.
At the bottom is a button to close the window.

An excel file is formatted in the "y-m-d_productivity_blister_pack_numWorkers_workers.xlsx"
format.
